    """Last-resort fallback for pages a plain httpx GET can't get real
    content from. UPDATED DIAGNOSIS (2026-08-12): the earlier theory here
    was a Cloudflare bot-challenge (based on this sandbox's WebFetch
    getting 403 on adzuna.ca) — but a direct httpx print from
    fetch_full_description showed a plain 200 with just an empty PAGE
    SKELETON, not a 403 or a challenge page. adzuna.ca/details/ pages are
    a client-rendered SPA: the initial HTML response is a near-empty shell
    and the actual job content gets injected by JavaScript after load —
    httpx never executes JS, so it can NEVER see that content no matter
    what headers/User-Agent it sends. This is why wait_until="networkidle"
    matters below (waits for the page's own JS/API calls to finish
    populating content) rather than "domcontentloaded" (fires as soon as
    the empty shell HTML is parsed, before any of that has happened) — an
    earlier version of this function used domcontentloaded and would have
    captured the same empty skeleton a plain httpx GET already sees,
    making the whole fallback pointless. (WebFetch's 403 might still be a
    separate, genuine bot-block layered on top for that specific tool/UA —
    unconfirmed either way; the SPA-skeleton issue is the one a real
    browser actually needs to solve, and does, by executing the JS.)

    Only called from fetch_full_description as a fallback when the plain
    request path found nothing useful — and that's only ever reached from
    fetch_adzuna's already-gated call site (title/location passed, snippet
    looks truncated), so this doesn't fire for the bulk of raw results,
    only the smallish set that already look like real candidates. Still
    meaningfully slower than an httpx call (browser launch + full page
    render), so keep that gating in place upstream — don't call this
    unguarded.

    Requires the optional `playwright` dependency (`pip install playwright
    && playwright install chromium` — see requirements.txt). Returns None
    if playwright isn't installed, the page errors, or the page loads but
    still has nothing to show for it (e.g. network never goes idle within
    the timeout, or there really is a bot-challenge underneath the SPA
    shell) — same "fail quietly, caller falls back to the short snippet"
    contract as the rest of this module. NOT verified against the real
    adzuna.ca from this sandbox (no network access here to test with) —

    and pull the full JD text. Adzuna's search API only ever returns a
    short teaser snippet — there's no "give me the full text" parameter —
    so this is the only way to get the real description.

    KNOWN LIMITATION, PARTIALLY MITIGATED (2026-08-12): when Adzuna is the
    terminal host for a job (no external ATS — the request lands on their
    own adzuna.ca/details/... page and stays there), a plain httpx request
    gets 403'd — confirmed with two real listings, and their API doesn't
    expose a full-description field anywhere either (checked their docs).
    As of 2026-08-12 this now falls back to a real headless browser (see
    fetch_via_browser) for that case, which has a real shot at clearing
    Cloudflare's bot-challenge where httpx has none — but isn't guaranteed
    (Cloudflare fingerprints headless browsers too) and hasn't been
    verified live from this sandbox (no network access here to test with).
    If it still comes back empty, jobs fall through to the short snippet
    unchanged, and ai_evaluate.py's looks_truncated() note is what keeps
    that from tanking match_score. This DOES still recover the full JD via
    the fast path for listings whose redirect_url is a tracking link that
    goes on to a recognized ATS (Greenhouse/Lever confirmed working; see
    below) — there's no reliable way to tell the two cases apart in
    advance, so every job still gets a real attempt at the fast path first.

    Returns {"description": str|None, "ats": str|None, "slug": str|None}.
    `description` is None only if EVERY path failed (plain request, known-
    ATS API, generic scrape, AND the browser fallback); callers must still
    fall back to the short snippet rather than let one bad job kill the
    run. `ats`/`slug` are set ONLY when the redirect resolved to a
    recognized ATS's own single-job API call that actually succeeded —
    that's the signal discover_companies.py uses to suggest adding the
    company to companies.yaml, since the slug is verified by a real
    successful request, not guessed from a URL (see companies.yaml's
    Coveo/Treewalk history for why that distinction matters — a slug
    parsed off a search-result URL burned real API calls on 404s twice
    before being caught).

    Prefers the source ATS's own JSON API (single-job endpoint — cheap,
    structured, matches what ats_clients.py already parses) when the
    redirect lands on a recognized board; falls back to scraping whatever
    HTML the final page returns; falls back further to a real browser if
    that HTML was empty/useless or the initial request failed outright."""
